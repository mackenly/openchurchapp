## Language

This app is designed to be made with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

## Installation

## Usage

The goal of this project is to make creating your church app as easy as possible. We understand that every church doesn’t have the budget to hire a developer and doesn’t have the knowledge to create an app in house. We want to help churches create a simple app with the least amount of tech skills as possible. The Open Church App is open source so you’re free to download, modify, and use its code for your church app for free!  Tha Learn more here: [Open Church App](https://churchmobile.app)
