Learn more at [ChurchMobile.App](https://churchmobile.app)

## Language

This app has been developed using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

Detailed docs and explainer videos coming soon...


## Usage

The goal of this project is to make creating your church app as easy as possible. We understand that every church doesn’t have the budget to hire a developer and doesn’t have the knowledge to create an app in house. We want to help churches create a simple app with the least amount of tech skills as possible. The Open Church App is open source so you’re free to download, modify, and use its code for your church app for free! Learn more here: [Open Church App](https://churchmobile.app)

## Planned Features

We plan to add dynamic data, push notifications, RSS feeds, sermon integration, publishing/customization services, and more.

Some features will be here for free in our Open Source project, but some that require databases will be offered in a low cost hosted service. There will likely be a free version to help with some features, but of course, some things incur high server costs and can't be free. The goal isn't to create a SaaS service but to make the open church app accessible to users of all technical abilities.

Open Source features will include:
- Push Notifications (One Signal)
- Analitic Integrations
- RSS Feeds
- Some 3rd Party Integrations
- Most App Pages

Hosted Service Features will include:
- Media Hosting
- Dashbaord Analytics
- Developer Customization Services
- Managment Dashbaord (online & app)
- Hosted Dynamic Data
- Online Giving
- App Store Publishing
- And More
